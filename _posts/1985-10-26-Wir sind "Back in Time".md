## "Back In Time"
##### (from "Back To The Future" soundtrack)

Tell me, doctor  
Where are we going this time?  
Is this the fifties?  
Or nineteen ninety-nine?  

All I wanted to do  
Was play my guitar and sing  

So take me away  
I don't mind  
You better promise me  
I'll be back in time  
Gotta get back in time  

Don't bet your future  
On one roll of the dice  
Better remember  
Lightning never strikes twice  

Please don't drive at eighty-eight  
Don't wanna be late again  

Take me away  
I don't mind  
You better better promise me  
I'll be back in time  
Gotta get back in time  
Gotta get back in time  
Get me back in time  

Gotta get back in time  
Gotta get back in time  
Get back, get back.  
(Get back, Marty.)  

Gotta get back in time  
Gotta get back in time  
Get back, get back.
