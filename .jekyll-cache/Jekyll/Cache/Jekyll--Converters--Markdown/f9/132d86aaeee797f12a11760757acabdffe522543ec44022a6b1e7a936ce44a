<h2 id="back-in-time">“Back In Time”</h2>
<h5 id="from-back-to-the-future-soundtrack">(from “Back To The Future” soundtrack)</h5>

<p>Tell me, doctor<br />
Where are we going this time?<br />
Is this the fifties?<br />
Or nineteen ninety-nine?</p>

<p>All I wanted to do<br />
Was play my guitar and sing</p>

<p>So take me away<br />
I don’t mind<br />
You better promise me<br />
I’ll be back in time<br />
Gotta get back in time</p>

<p>Don’t bet your future<br />
On one roll of the dice<br />
Better remember<br />
Lightning never strikes twice</p>

<p>Please don’t drive at eighty-eight<br />
Don’t wanna be late again</p>

<p>Take me away<br />
I don’t mind<br />
You better better promise me<br />
I’ll be back in time<br />
Gotta get back in time<br />
Gotta get back in time<br />
Get me back in time</p>

<p>Gotta get back in time<br />
Gotta get back in time<br />
Get back, get back.<br />
(Get back, Marty.)</p>

<p>Gotta get back in time<br />
Gotta get back in time<br />
Get back, get back.</p>
